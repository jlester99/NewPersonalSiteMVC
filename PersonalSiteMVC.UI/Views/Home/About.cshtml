                    I am a Software Engineer based in Kansas City, Missouri and a recent graduate of Centriq Training.  <br />My career in the Information Technology field began over 20 years ago after receiving a Bachelors Degree in Computer Information Systems.  I spent the majority of my career in the healthcare and finance sector, primarily for one company, using Mainframe technologies.  During this time, I performed various roles in delivering quality and efficient projects using both Agile and Waterfall methodologies.  Then, in 2018, when that company was sold, I found myself in a new job where I felt unfulfilled and no longer challenged.  I knew it was time for a change, but also knew I wanted to stay in IT development, where I really enjoyed the problem-solving, critical thinking, and the logic side. So, I made the decision to move on which led me to enroll in <a href=https://www.centriq.com/career/it-career-program/what-you-learn> Centriq's Full Stack Web Developer Training.</a>. In this accelerated training, I gained hands-on training performing labs and creating projects, both independently and as a team, including some pair programming.  I am now looking forward to new opportunities where I can hone my new skillset as a Web Developer, continue to learn new technologies, as well as leverage my vast amount of IT experience to be mutually beneficial.  Feel free to connect with me on <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/janet-lester">LinkedIn</a> and to browse My <a href="@Url.Action("Portfolio", "Home")">Portfolio</a> page here which showcases the projects and labs I have completed as a Full Stack Developer. <br />
